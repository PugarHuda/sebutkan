/**
 * Per-agent Venice models — Sebutkan
 *
 * A multi-agent system should use the RIGHT model for each job, not one model for
 * everything. Venice exposes 250+ models through one API, so each specialist picks
 * a model suited to its task — fast/cheap for routing, strong for verification.
 * All defaults are confirmed available on the project key; override via env.
 *
 * Web-search calls (Synthesizer, Fact-checker) stay on venice-uncensored, which
 * reliably supports Venice's server-side web search.
